Abstract

In the current globalization, even though global inequality has reduced (between nations), it has increased inequality within nations. In the last 30 years, inequality within most nations has risen significantly, particularly among advanced countries. In this period, close to 90 percent of advanced economies have seen an increase in income inequality. Research suggests that economic growth and macroeconomic stability are greatly affected by inequality. Now a days inequality is at the center stage of economic policy debate across the globe, as government tax and spending policies have significant effects on income distribution. Governments of different countries have been trying their best to address this problem and provide an optimal solution. The aim of this study is to find a solution for the income inequality problem using machine learning and data mining techniques. The goal is to explore the U.S. Census-22 dataset and develop a classification model to predict whether an individual's income will be in “Low” or “High” category. This prediction will be based on several demographic and employment related variables that describe the personal income data. 
In addition, I will apply three different feature selection methods (Filter, Wrapper, and Embedded) and will compare the performance of five the machine learning algorithms (Logistic regression, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) on each selected group of features to see which method is best. This will help to investigate which variables are highly correlated with our target variable “Income”. Lastly, based on top attributes I will compare all five machine learning algorithms to see which one will outperform in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and stability.
